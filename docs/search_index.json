(Spiro and Weitz 1990) Adaptive selling: conceptualization, measurement, and nomological validity Introduce the skill of adaptive selling. even thought all adapt, but to what extent is not clear. how effective is not clear. A 16-item scale is developed to measure the degree to which salespeople practice adaptive selling-the degree to which they alter their sales presentation across and during customer interactions in response to the perceived nature of the sales situ- ation. This paper-and-pencil scale assesses self-reports of five facets of adaptive selling: (1) recognition that different sales approaches are needed for different cus- tomers, (2) confidence in ability to use a variety of approaches, (3) confidence in ability to alter approach during an interaction, (4) collection of information to fa- cilitate adaptation, and (5) actual use of different approaches. The reliability of the scale is .85. Support for the nomological validity of the scale is found by failure to disconfirm relationships with an antecedent (intrinsic motivation), several general personality measures of interpersonal flexibility (self-monitoring, empathy, locus of control, and androgyny), and a consequence (self-reported perfo (Mullins et al. 2014) Know Your Customer: How Salesperson Perceptions of Customer Relationship Quality Form and Influence Account Profitability salespeoples skill in sense the customer impacts the account profit Firms often utilize salesperson intelligence in marketing strategies to improve sales performance. However, this approach is problematic if the information is based on inaccurate perceptions. In light of this, the authors introduce a theoretical model to study the antecedents and profit impact of salesperson perceptions of customer relationship quality. Dyadic analyses using matched survey responses from salespersoncustomer dyads and secondary performance data reveal several insightful findings. Results show that self-efficacious salespeople are upwardly biased, whereas customer-oriented salespeople are downwardly biased in their perceptions of customer relationship quality. However, managers can correct these inaccuracies using a behavior-based control system. Response surface analyses illustrate that the effects of salesperson accuracy and inaccuracy are distinct and curvilinear. During later relationship phases, salespeople profit more from salesperson accuracy in high- and lowquality relationships (i.e., a U-shaped effect). Yet the increasingly harmful impact of salesperson inaccuracy on profit is more severe during earlier relationship phases. Together, these findings highlight the benefits of measuring salesperson perceptions and how to manage them (Roman Avila and Iacobucci 2010) Antecedents and consequences of adaptive selling confidence and behavior: a dyadic analysis of salespeople and their customers antecdent and consequence of adaptive selling Personal selling is thought to be a very effective marketing vehicle. The notion of adaptive selling suggests that it should work better than any other means of communication because salespeople are able to develop a unique message for each customer. This research proposes a model of key antecedents and consequences of adaptive selling. In particular, we distinguish, measure, and model the attitudinal and behavioral aspects of adaptive selling, something that is encouraged but not thoroughly examined in the literature. Hypotheses are tested using data from 210 salesperson-customer dyads. The results indicate that a salespersons perception of the firms customer orientation has an effect on adaptive selling behavior through the salespersons adaptive selling confidence, role ambiguity, intrinsic motivation and customer-qualification skills. Adaptive selling behavior increases salespersons outcome performance, customers evaluations of satisfaction with the product and with the salesperson, which enhance customers anticipation of future interactions with the salesperson. The implications for management and theory are discussed. 1.0.2 Communication - intraorganization (Johlke et al. 2000) Sales managers impact on the salesperson job outcomes drawing from several diverse streams of research, the authors develop the rationale and empirical background for considering the role of sales manager communication practices. Using a multifaceted conceptualization of communication as its base, the study justifies, proposes, and evaluates a model describing the relations among sales managerscommunication practices and salesperson ambiguity, satisfaction, performance, and commitment. The results support the hypothesized model and suggest that sales manager communication practices are associated with these important salesperson job outcomes. (Bolander et al. 2015) Social Networks Within Sales Organizations: Their Development and Importance for Salesperson Performance Salespeoples communication among peers on their job performance Although the study of salesperson performance traditionally has focused on salespeoples activities and relationships with customers, scholars recently have proposed that salespeoples intraorganizational relationships and activities also play a vital role in driving sales performance. Using data from 286 salespeople in a unique social network analysis, the authors explore the effects of salespeoples intraorganizational relationships on objective salesperson performance as well as the role of political skill in developing intraorganizational relationships. The results indicate that two types of social network characteristics (i.e., relational centrality and positional centrality) contribute substantially to salesperson performance. Moreover, salespeoples political skill is shown to be an antecedent to relational centrality but, surprisingly, not positional centrality. This finding demonstrates that researchers should not assume that all centralities represent similar underlying network characteristics. In light of these results, the authors discuss several implications for both managers and researchers as well as directions for further research 1.0.3 Communication Interorganization - FLE interactions (S. K. Singh, n.d.) E-negotiations, or sales negotiations over email, are increasingly common in business-to-business (B2B) sales, but little is known about selling effectiveness in this medium. This research investigates salespeoples use of influence tactics as textual cues to manage buyers attention during B2B e-negotiations to win sales contract award. Drawing on studies of attention as a selection heuristic, the authors advance the literature on mechanisms of sales influence by theorizing buyer attention as a key mediating variable between the use of influence tactics and contract award. They use a unique, longitudinal panel spanning more than two years of email communications between buyers and salespeople during B2B sales negotiations to develop a validated corpus of textual cues that are diagnostic of salespeoples influence tactics in e-negotiations. These e-communications data are augmented by salesperson in-depth interviews and survey, archival performance data, and a controlled experimental study with professional salespeople. The obtained results indicate that the concurrent use of compliance or internalization-based tactics as textual cues bolsters buyers attention and is associated with greater likelihood of contract award. In contrast, concurrent use of compliance and internalization-based tactics is prone to degrade buyer attention and likely to put the salesperson at a disadvantage in closing the contract award. (S. Singh et al. 2017) Using a novel approach with video-recordings of sales interactions, this study focuses on a dynamic analysis of salesperson effectiveness in handling customer queries. We conceptualize salesperson behaviors, namely, resolving, relating, and emoting, as separate elements of customer query handling and empirically identify the distinct verbal and nonverbal cues that salespeople use to display these behaviors during sales interactions. We draw from compensation effects in social cognition theory to propose that customers perceptions of a salespersons effectiveness are prone to trade-offs between competence (resolving behaviors) and warmth (relating and emoting behaviors). Results, robust to endogeneity corrections, support the proposed tradeoffs such that the effectiveness of salespersons resolving behavior is significantly curtailed, even neutralized, by the salespersons relating and emoting behaviors. We situate these counterintuitive results within the extant theory and research on sales interactions, and outline implications for practice. (Boorom, Goolsby, and Ramsey 1998) Relational Communication Traits and Their Effect on Adaptiveness and Sales Performance How does the salesperson trait affects the communication effectiveness and then on the job performance. Two relational communication traits, communication apprehension and interaction involvement, are investigated within an adaptive selling framework to assess their impact on salesperson adaptiveness and sales performance. Using a sample of 239 insurance salespeople, results demonstrate that salespeople exhibiting lower levels of communication apprehension are more highly involved in communication interactions, and higher involvement facilitates increased adaptiveness and sales performance. This research highlights the importance of effective communication within sales interactions and offers suggestions to improve salesperson communication skill (Soldow and Thomas 1984) Relational Communication: Form versus Content in the Sales Interaction two type of f2f comm: content and relationship In view of the importance of interpersonal com- munication in the face-to-face selling interaction, this discussion seeks to provide a more complete picture of the actual communication process by introducing a concept new to the marketing liter- ature. The concept is relational communication, which refers to that part of a message beyond the actual content which allows communicators to ne- gotiate their relative positions. Thus, the message sender can either bid for dominance, deference, or equality. The message receiver, in turn, can ac- cept the bid or deny 1.0.4 Sales marketing interface (T. M. Smith, Gopalakrishna, and Chatterjee 2006) A Three-Stage Model of Integrated Marketing Communications at the MarketingSales Interface The marketing and sales functions in many firms are often at odds despite their common goal of increasing revenue and profit. The finger pointing goes both ways: Marketing complains of poor lead follow-up by sales, and in turn, sales grumbles about the quality of leads generated by marketing. This disconnect can be damaging; high lead volumes generated through effective marketing campaigns could actually hurt downstream sales because of wasted effort on poorly qualified leads and/or delays in sales follow-up resulting from limited sales force capacity. To examine the revenue and profit implications of coordinated communications efforts at the marketingsales interface, the authors develop a three-stage model that captures the effects of sequential marketing/sales communications on lead generation, appointment conversion, and sales closure. The results, which are based on a collaborative effort with a large home improvement retailer, suggest a complex interplay among marketing efforts (multiple media that generate leads), delays in follow-up (time lag between inquiry and sales force contact), and sales efficiencies (appointment and sales conversion). The findings underscore the impact of multimedia spending on the timing and effectiveness of subsequent communications, implying that improved internal collaboration between marketing and sales can offer significant upside potential for the firm. Finally, the authors develop a managerial decision support tool to simulate the impact of varying communications budgets, timing, and allocation on the marketing and sales planning system. 1.0.5 Firm level impact on salespeople (Salonen et al. 2020) Engaging a product-focused sales force in solution selling: interplay of individual- and organizational-level conditions Solution selling transform from product focused selling . This study explains how manufacturers tackle the critical managerial challenge of transforming a product-focused sales force to undertake solution selling. Through an application of configurational theory, the authors explain how individual and organizational conditions combine to determine salespeoples engagement in solution selling. Multilevel, multisource data from the sales organization of a global supplier of building solutions represent input from salespeople (N = 184), solution champions (N = 23), and sales managers (N = 26). A fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis reveals no single, optimal way to overcome transformation challenges. Rather, consistent with prior research, solution selling requires certain types of salespeople, because valuebased selling is a necessary condition for successful engagement. Beyond this foundational condition, a heterogeneous sales force can be engaged, as long as the organization provides appropriate support that is tailored to individual salespersons needs. The findings affirm that this viable support can come from either sales managers or solution champions (J. B. Smith and Barclay 1997) The Effects of Organizational Differences and Trust on the Effectiveness of Selling Partner Relationships organizational level selling together Selling alliances that are formed to cooperatively develop and maintain customer relationships are among the new organizational forms that marketing managers utilize for competitive advantage. To be successful, these alliances require sales representatives from allied organizations to work effectively as selling partners. The authors develop a trust-based model of effective selling partner relationships and test it in the context of the computer industry. Par- tial Least Squares analysis of 103 dyadic relationships found that organizational differences were modest predic- tors of three dimensions of mutual perceived trustworthiness, which in turn differentially affected three trusting behaviors. Trusting behaviors were found to have a somewhat greater effect on perceived task performance than on mutual satisfaction, whereas dimensions of trustworthiness had both direct and indirect effects on satisfaction. The authors discuss the managerial and theoretical implications of th 1.0.6 Salesperson trait orientation (Kidwell et al. 2011) Emotional Intelligence in Marketing Exchanges EQs impact on the sales performance This research examines how sales professionals use emotions in marketing exchanges to facilitate positive outcomes for their firms, themselves, and their customers. The authors conduct three field studies to examine the impact of emotional intelligence (EI) in marketing exchanges on sales performance and customer relationships. They find that EI is positively related to performance of real estate and insurance agents, even when controlling for the effects of domain-general EI, self-report EI, cognitive ability, and several control variables. Sales professionals with higher EI are not only superior revenue generators but also better at retaining customers. In addition, the authors demonstrate that EI interacts with key marketing exchange variablescustomer orientation and manifest influenceto heighten performance such that high-EI salespeople more effectively employ customer-oriented selling and influence customer decisions. Finally, the results indicate a complementary relationship between EI and cognitive ability in that EI positively influences performance at higher levels of cognitive ability. These findings have implications for improving interactions between buyers and sellers and for employee selection and training (McFarland, Rode, and Shervani 2015) Moderator of the EQs effect on job outcomes A contingency model of emotional intelligence in professional selling Abstract Despite significant attention from practitioners and broad claims of the importance of Emotional Intelligence (EI), empirical support for its incremental direct effects on outcomes relevant to professional selling has been disappointing. However, little research has included relevant contextual variables or the potential interactions of EI with contextual variables when considering its effects. This contingency view of EI maintains that EI is important in work settings, but only under certain conditions. Drawing on the appraisal theory of emotions, the authors develop a contingency model, which proposes that salesperson EI moderates the harmful effects of role stress on three work outcomesemotional exhaustion, customer-oriented selling, and sales performance. Using three matched data sources from multiple professional selling workgroups in a business-tobusiness sales setting, the authors find that EI moderates the relationship between role ambiguity and all three outcome variables. (Lam, DeCarlo, and Sharma 2019) Salesperson ambidexterity in customer engagement: do customer base characteristics matter? salesperson orientation moderated by customer base on sales performance This research examines how sales professionals use emotions in marketing exchanges to facilitate positive outcomes for their firms, themselves, and their customers. The authors conduct three field studies to examine the impact of emotional intelligence (EI) in marketing exchanges on sales performance and customer relationships. They find that EI is positively related to performance of real estate and insurance agents, even when controlling for the effects of domain-general EI, self-report EI, cognitive ability, and several control variables. Sales professionals with higher EI are not only superior revenue generators but also better at retaining customers. In addition, the authors demonstrate that EI interacts with key marketing exchange variablescustomer orientation and manifest influenceto heighten performance such that high-EI salespeople more effectively employ customer-oriented selling and influence customer decisions. Finally, the results indicate a complementary relationship between EI and cognitive ability in that EI positively influences performance at higher levels of cognitive ability. These findings have implications for improving interactions between buyers and sellers and for employee selection and training 1.0.7 Salesperson non-sales activity/ service (Johnson and Sohi 2015) Understanding and resolving major contractual breaches in buyerseller relationships: a grounded theory approach Abstract In business-to-business relationships, sellers are often faced with instances of contractual breaches by buyers. In many cases, relationship factors preclude legal enforcement of contract terms, requiring sellers to explore alternate resolution options. Literature on contractual breaches has primarily focused on enforcement options based on terms specified in the contract. However, little is known about how companies deal with contractual breaches by their customers when legal enforcement is not a viable option. The authors use a grounded theory approach to investigate this important issue. Based on in-depth interviews with 40 supplier managers and executives in multiple industries, the authors identify: (a) types of out-ofcontract alternatives for resolving breaches, (b) factors that lead to use of enforcement options outside the terms specified in the contract, (c) contextual influences, and (d) individual and firm-level consequences of outside-ofcontract enforcement. (Malshe and Friend 2018) Initiating value co-creation: Dealing with non-receptive customers deal with co-creation reluctance. co-creation to improve the offering. Scholarly emphasis on the significance of integrating customer and supplier work processes to co-create customer value is increasingly important. While suppliers and customers working closely is imperative for the success of the value co-creation (VCC) process, customers reluctance at times to allow suppliers into their environments has not been fully explored. The present study is an expansive qualitative inquiry consisting of 114 in-depth interviews across 57 business-to-business evaluations that aims to understand both the nuanced nature of customer non-receptivity to specific VCC initiatives and those strategies suppliers may adopt to successfully manage it. Findings elicit three potential kinds of customer non-receptivity: apathy, ambivalence, and annoyance. Furthermore, conclusions propose six strategies suppliers may use to manage customer non-receptivity: intrinsic initiative, inspiration and implementation, complexity absorption, value alignment, credibility building, and objective centrality. (Panagopoulos, Rapp, and Ogilvie 2017) Salesperson Solution Involvement and Sales Performance: The Contingent Role of Supplier Firm and CustomerSupplier Relationship Characteristics salespeople invovled in the solution (not solution selling)s impaact on the long term performance Salespeople play a crucial role in their firms efforts to provide customer solutions. However, little research has examined how salesperson involvement in customer solutions can be conceptualized, whether it pays off, and what boundary conditions might heighten its performance effects. This study addresses these gaps and offers a conceptualization of salesperson solution involvement by focusing on the set of salesperson-related activities that enact the four relational processes inherent in customer solutions. The authors collect a unique data set that includes a wide range of firms, industries, and countries, as well as the perspectives of both salespeople and customers, across five studies. Results validate the stability of the conceptualization across contexts. They also reveal that salesperson solution involvement is systematically related to increases in both subjective and objective, time-lagged measures of sales performance. Finally, results show that the performance effects of salesperson solution involvement are amplified under higher levels of firms product portfolio scope, sales unit cross-functional cooperation, and customersupplier relationship tie strength. Surprisingly, customer adaptiveness is not found to moderate the performance effects of salesperson solution involvement. 1.0.8 B2G selling (Chase and Murtha 2019) In business-to-government and business-to-business transactions, suppliers often have limited access to buyers during the buying process. The authors term these buyers barricaded buyers. Despite the prevalence of barricaded buyers in practice, research has remained largely silent on the topic. Therefore, the authors combine insights from eight organizational purchasing case studies and individual interviews with signaling theory to advance a conceptual framework that highlights ways a supplier can increase its competitiveness (and, correspondingly, its selection likelihood) when selling to barricaded buyers. The framework reflects three distinct ways in which signaling occurs or influences the barricaded buying process: the seller signals to buyers (e.g., through novel solutions, explicit responding), the seller signals to competing sellers (e.g., through peacocking), and the buyer signals to sellers whose meaning is jammed (e.g., through supplier-specific capabilities and language). The framework invokes barricade restrictiveness as an important contingency variable that lends nuance to when the signaling activities are most likely to affect suppliers competitiveness.

Persuasion knowledge refers to consumers theories about persuasion and includes beliefs about marketers motives, strategies, and tactics; What kind of persuasion tactics are effectiveness and appropriateness; psychological mediators of tactic effectiveness (i.e., if the influencer is trying to gain trust, to invoke sympathy); and ways of coping with persuasion attempts. Theory: Persuasion knowledge is an effortful elaboration. Thus, the consumer needs both the cognitive bandwidth to think and the accessibility to the cue that the agent has the ulterior motive. Finding: When an ulterior persuasion motive is highly accessible, both cognitively busy targets and unbusy observers use persuasion knowledge to evaluate the salesperson. When an ulterior motive is less accessible, cognitively busy targets are less likely to use persuasion knowledge, evaluating the salesperson as more sincere than are cognitively unbusy observers. Contribution: a) The first paper empirically investigates when the persuasion knowledge will be used. b) The outcome is the perception of the salespeople (i.e., sincerity). c) minor contribution: the method to manipulate accessibility and cognitive busyness (e..g, priming, target observer status) Critique: a) The observer doesnt care about the purchase. Thus, s/he focuses too much on over-interpreting the salespeoples persuasion attempt. For example, when the salespeople have absolutely no intention to persuade (e.g., after the purchase is made), the observer still suspects the salespeople much more than the actor. However, the observers use of persuasion knowledge may be of little interest in strategy research. I am not sure about the usefulness of the finding to the manager. 2.1.0.2 Marketing strategy application (Thompson and Malaviya 2013): RQ &amp; Concept: How does awareness of advertising co-creators identity help or hurt persuasion perceived by the audience? consumer-generated ads: the consumer participated in the ads creation process. Theory: An important element of consumer persuasion knowledge is their belief about the persuasion competence of agents or to what extent the agents are perceived to know about effectively influencing buying decisions. When the ads creator is a consumer, the consumer is perceived to be less competent (i.e., do not know how to create a professional ad). The less competent creator leads the audience to perceive the ads as less persuasive. As a consequence, the evaluation of the ads is lower. Finding: The authors find that disclosing ads is created by a consumer will lead to negative advertisement and brand evaluations. The effect is mediated through skepticism path (-) and identification path (+). The two paths are moderated by cognitive resources and background information about the ad creator and brand loyalty. Contribution: The papers WoW factor is a) it is hard to guess which path would dominate skepticism or identification. The intuition is the identification, but the result is skepticism. b) prior research only looks at the positive effect of consumer-generated content. However, in this case, it is negative. 2.1.1 Summary for PKM in online environment Overall, the consumer is more likely to use the persuasion knowledge if they can access the ulterior motivation as in the context of the advertising (vs. consumer report) and the salespeople negotiation. The online environment should make the accessibility even higher as the consumer tends to be more skeptical of the salespeople when they cannot observe the non-verbal cues. The online environment can be ambiguous if the consumer has cognitive bandwidth. On the one hand, the consumer doesnt need to pay attention to maintaining the non-verbal cues, which can be resources draining. On the other hand, the consumer may not have the full attention to the interaction as the many background tasks distract the consumer. Therefore, it is hard to predict if the online environment will be more conducive to using user-generated ads. If the bandwidth is low, then the user-generated ads will be more effective. However, when the bandwidth is high or the consumer is involved in processing the information (i.e., they click the ads), then the user-generated ads will be less effective. When the consumer can access the persuasion knowledge, it seems that the result is often negative compared to when they cannot access it. For example, the foot-in-the-door tactic would be less effective in getting into the door if the consumer senses the salespeople are tricking him/her. However, comparing persuasion vs. no persuasion, the effect on the subjects influence is less clear. As the persuasion attempt becomes less effective when PKM is invoked, yet no persuasion is ineffective in driving the action. For the online environment, if the salespeople persuade using scarcity or non-scarcity tactics, the former is more likely to raise skepticism, yet it is also more effective in driving action in general. Based on the PKM, the persuasion without scarcity tactic that could raise skepticism would be more effective.
