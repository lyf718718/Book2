<p>Adaptive selling: conceptualization, measurement, and nomological
validity</p>
<p>Introduce the skill of adaptive selling. even thought all adapt, but to
what extent is not clear. how effective is not clear.</p>
<p>A 16-item scale is developed to measure the degree to which salespeople
practice adaptive selling-the degree to which they alter their sales
presentation across and during customer interactions in response to the
perceived nature of the sales situ- ation. This paper-and-pencil scale
assesses self-reports of five facets of adaptive selling: (1)
recognition that different sales approaches are needed for different
cus- tomers, (2) confidence in ability to use a variety of approaches,
(3) confidence in ability to alter approach during an interaction, (4)
collection of information to fa- cilitate adaptation, and (5) actual use
of different approaches. The reliability of the scale is .85. Support
for the nomological validity of the scale is found by failure to
disconfirm relationships with an antecedent (intrinsic motivation),
several general personality measures of interpersonal flexibility
(self-monitoring, empathy, locus of control, and androgyny), and a
consequence (self-reported perfo</p>

<p>Know Your Customer: How Salesperson Perceptions of Customer Relationship
Quality Form and Influence Account Profitability</p>
<p>salespeople’s skill in sense the customer impacts the account profit</p>
<p>Firms often utilize salesperson intelligence in marketing strategies to
improve sales performance. However, this approach is problematic if the
information is based on inaccurate perceptions. In light of this, the
authors introduce a theoretical model to study the antecedents and
profit impact of salesperson perceptions of customer relationship
quality. Dyadic analyses using matched survey responses from
salesperson–customer dyads and secondary performance data reveal
several insightful findings. Results show that self-efficacious
salespeople are upwardly biased, whereas customer-oriented salespeople
are downwardly biased in their perceptions of customer relationship
quality. However, managers can correct these inaccuracies using a
behavior-based control system. Response surface analyses illustrate that
the effects of salesperson accuracy and inaccuracy are distinct and
curvilinear. During later relationship phases, salespeople profit more
from salesperson accuracy in high- and lowquality relationships (i.e., a
U-shaped effect). Yet the increasingly harmful impact of salesperson
inaccuracy on profit is more severe during earlier relationship phases.
Together, these findings highlight the benefits of measuring salesperson
perceptions and how to manage them</p>

<p>Antecedents and consequences of adaptive selling confidence and
behavior: a dyadic analysis of salespeople and their customers</p>
<p>antecdent and consequence of adaptive selling</p>
<p>Personal selling is thought to be a very effective marketing vehicle.
The notion of adaptive selling suggests that it should work better than
any other means of communication because salespeople are able to develop
a unique message for each customer. This research proposes a model of
key antecedents and consequences of adaptive selling. In particular, we
distinguish, measure, and model the attitudinal and behavioral aspects
of adaptive selling, something that is encouraged but not thoroughly
examined in the literature. Hypotheses are tested using data from 210
salesperson-customer dyads. The results indicate that a salesperson’s
perception of the firm’s customer orientation has an effect on adaptive
selling behavior through the salesperson’s adaptive selling confidence,
role ambiguity, intrinsic motivation and customer-qualification skills.
Adaptive selling behavior increases salesperson’s outcome performance,
customers’ evaluations of satisfaction with the product and with the
salesperson, which enhance customers’ anticipation of future
interactions with the salesperson. The implications for management and
theory are discussed.</p>

<p>Sales manager’s impact on the salesperson job outcomes</p>
<p>drawing from several diverse streams of research, the authors develop
the rationale and empirical background for considering the role of sales
manager communication practices. Using a multifaceted conceptualization
of communication as its base, the study justifies, proposes, and
evaluates a model describing the relations among sales
managers’communication practices and salesperson ambiguity,
satisfaction, performance, and commitment. The results support the
hypothesized model and suggest that sales manager communication
practices are associated with these important salesperson job outcomes.</p>

<p>Social Networks Within Sales Organizations: Their Development and
Importance for Salesperson Performance</p>
<p>Salespeople’s communication among peers on their job performance</p>
<p>Although the study of salesperson performance traditionally has focused
on salespeople’s activities and relationships with customers, scholars
recently have proposed that salespeople’s intraorganizational
relationships and activities also play a vital role in driving sales
performance. Using data from 286 salespeople in a unique social network
analysis, the authors explore the effects of salespeople’s
intraorganizational relationships on objective salesperson performance
as well as the role of political skill in developing intraorganizational
relationships. The results indicate that two types of social network
characteristics (i.e., relational centrality and positional centrality)
contribute substantially to salesperson performance. Moreover,
salespeople’s political skill is shown to be an antecedent to relational
centrality but, surprisingly, not positional centrality. This finding
demonstrates that researchers should not assume that all centralities
represent similar underlying network characteristics. In light of these
results, the authors discuss several implications for both managers and
researchers as well as directions for further research</p>

<p>E-negotiations, or sales negotiations over email, are increasingly
common in business-to-business (B2B) sales, but little is known about
selling effectiveness in this medium. This research investigates
salespeople’s use of influence tactics as textual cues to manage buyers’
attention during B2B e-negotiations to win sales contract award. Drawing
on studies of attention as a selection heuristic, the authors advance
the literature on mechanisms of sales influence by theorizing buyer
attention as a key mediating variable between the use of influence
tactics and contract award. They use a unique, longitudinal panel
spanning more than two years of email communications between buyers and
salespeople during B2B sales negotiations to develop a validated corpus
of textual cues that are diagnostic of salespeople’s influence tactics
in e-negotiations. These e-communications data are augmented by
salesperson in-depth interviews and survey, archival performance data,
and a controlled experimental study with professional salespeople. The
obtained results indicate that the concurrent use of compliance <em>or</em>
internalization-based tactics as textual cues bolsters buyers’ attention
and is associated with greater likelihood of contract award. In
contrast, concurrent use of compliance <em>and</em> internalization-based
tactics is prone to degrade buyer attention and likely to put the
salesperson at a disadvantage in closing the contract award.</p>

<p>Using a novel approach with video-recordings of sales interactions, this
study focuses on a dynamic analysis of salesperson effectiveness in
handling customer queries. We conceptualize salesperson behaviors,
namely, <em>resolving</em>, <em>relating</em>, and <em>emoting</em>, as separate elements of
customer query handling and empirically identify the distinct verbal and
nonverbal cues that salespeople use to display these behaviors during
sales interactions. We draw from compensation effects in social
cognition theory to propose that customers’ perceptions of a
salesperson’s effectiveness are prone to trade-offs between competence
(resolving behaviors) and warmth (relating and emoting behaviors).
Results, robust to endogeneity corrections, support the proposed
tradeoffs such that the effectiveness of salesperson’s resolving
behavior is significantly curtailed, even neutralized, by the
salesperson’s relating and emoting behaviors. We situate these
counterintuitive results within the extant theory and research on sales
interactions, and outline implications for practice.</p>

<p>Relational Communication Traits and Their Effect on Adaptiveness and
Sales Performance</p>
<p>How does the salesperson trait affects the communication effectiveness
and then on the job performance.</p>
<p>Two relational communication traits, communication apprehension and
interaction involvement, are investigated within an adaptive selling
framework to assess their impact on salesperson adaptiveness and sales
performance. Using a sample of 239 insurance salespeople, results
demonstrate that salespeople exhibiting lower levels of communication
apprehension are more highly involved in communication interactions, and
higher involvement facilitates increased adaptiveness and sales
performance. This research highlights the importance of effective
communication within sales interactions and offers suggestions to
improve salesperson communication skill</p>

<p>In view of the importance of interpersonal com- munication in the
face-to-face selling interaction, this discussion seeks to provide a
more complete picture of the actual communication process by introducing
a concept new to the marketing liter- ature. The concept is relational
communication, which refers to that part of a message beyond the actual
content which allows communicators to ne- gotiate their relative
positions. Thus, the message sender can either bid for dominance,
deference, or equality. The message receiver, in turn, can ac- cept the
bid or deny</p>

<p>A Three-Stage Model of Integrated Marketing Communications at the
Marketing–Sales Interface</p>
<p>The marketing and sales functions in many firms are often at odds
despite their common goal of increasing revenue and profit. The finger
pointing goes both ways: Marketing complains of poor lead follow-up by
sales, and in turn, sales grumbles about the quality of leads generated
by marketing. This disconnect can be damaging; high lead volumes
generated through effective marketing campaigns could actually hurt
downstream sales because of wasted effort on poorly qualified leads
and/or delays in sales follow-up resulting from limited sales force
capacity. To examine the revenue and profit implications of coordinated
communications efforts at the marketing–sales interface, the authors
develop a three-stage model that captures the effects of sequential
marketing/sales communications on lead generation, appointment
conversion, and sales closure. The results, which are based on a
collaborative effort with a large home improvement retailer, suggest a
complex interplay among marketing efforts (multiple media that generate
leads), delays in follow-up (time lag between inquiry and sales force
contact), and sales efficiencies (appointment and sales conversion). The
findings underscore the impact of multimedia spending on the timing and
effectiveness of subsequent communications, implying that improved
internal collaboration between marketing and sales can offer significant
upside potential for the firm. Finally, the authors develop a managerial
decision support tool to simulate the impact of varying communications
budgets, timing, and allocation on the marketing and sales planning
system.</p>

<p>Engaging a product-focused sales force in solution selling: interplay of
individual- and organizational-level conditions Solution selling
transform from product focused selling .</p>
<p>This study explains how manufacturers tackle the critical managerial
challenge of transforming a product-focused sales force to undertake
solution selling. Through an application of configurational theory, the
authors explain how individual and organizational conditions combine to
determine salespeople’s engagement in solution selling. Multilevel,
multisource data from the sales organization of a global supplier of
building solutions represent input from salespeople (N = 184), solution
champions (N = 23), and sales managers (N = 26). A fuzzy set qualitative
comparative analysis reveals no single, optimal way to overcome
transformation challenges. Rather, consistent with prior research,
solution selling requires certain types of salespeople, because
valuebased selling is a necessary condition for successful engagement.
Beyond this foundational condition, a heterogeneous sales force can be
engaged, as long as the organization provides appropriate support that
is tailored to individual salespersons’ needs. The findings affirm that
this viable support can come from either sales managers or solution
champions</p>

<p>Selling alliances that are formed to cooperatively develop and maintain
customer relationships are among the new organizational forms that
marketing managers utilize for competitive advantage. To be successful,
these alliances require sales representatives from allied organizations
to work effectively as selling partners. The authors develop a
trust-based model of effective selling partner relationships and test it
in the context of the computer industry. Par- tial Least Squares
analysis of 103 dyadic relationships found that organizational
differences were modest predic- tors of three dimensions of mutual
perceived trustworthiness, which in turn differentially affected three
trusting behaviors. Trusting behaviors were found to have a somewhat
greater effect on perceived task performance than on mutual
satisfaction, whereas dimensions of trustworthiness had both direct and
indirect effects on satisfaction. The authors discuss the managerial and

<p>Emotional Intelligence in Marketing Exchanges</p>
<p>EQ’s impact on the sales performance</p>
<p>This research examines how sales professionals use emotions in marketing
exchanges to facilitate positive outcomes for their firms, themselves,
and their customers. The authors conduct three field studies to examine
the impact of emotional intelligence (EI) in marketing exchanges on
sales performance and customer relationships. They find that EI is
positively related to performance of real estate and insurance agents,
even when controlling for the effects of domain-general EI, self-report
EI, cognitive ability, and several control variables. Sales
professionals with higher EI are not only superior revenue generators
but also better at retaining customers. In addition, the authors
demonstrate that EI interacts with key marketing exchange
variables—customer orientation and manifest influence—to heighten
performance such that high-EI salespeople more effectively employ
customer-oriented selling and influence customer decisions. Finally, the
results indicate a complementary relationship between EI and cognitive
ability in that EI positively influences performance at higher levels of
cognitive ability. These findings have implications for improving
interactions between buyers and sellers and for employee selection and
training</p>

<p>Moderator of the EQ’s effect on job outcomes</p>
<p>A contingency model of emotional intelligence in professional selling
Abstract Despite significant attention from practitioners and broad
claims of the importance of Emotional Intelligence (EI), empirical
support for its incremental direct effects on outcomes relevant to
professional selling has been disappointing. However, little research
has included relevant contextual variables or the potential interactions
of EI with contextual variables when considering its effects. This
contingency view of EI maintains that EI is important in work settings,
but only under certain conditions. Drawing on the appraisal theory of
emotions, the authors develop a contingency model, which proposes that
salesperson EI moderates the harmful effects of role stress on three
work outcomes—emotional exhaustion, customer-oriented selling, and
sales performance. Using three matched data sources from multiple
professional selling workgroups in a business-tobusiness sales setting,
the authors find that EI moderates the relationship between role
ambiguity and all three outcome variables.</p>

<p>Understanding and resolving major contractual breaches in buyer–seller
relationships: a grounded theory approach</p>
<p>Abstract In business-to-business relationships, sellers are often faced
with instances of contractual breaches by buyers. In many cases,
relationship factors preclude legal enforcement of contract terms,
requiring sellers to explore alternate resolution options. Literature on
contractual breaches has primarily focused on enforcement options based
on terms specified in the contract. However, little is known about how
companies deal with contractual breaches by their customers when legal
enforcement is not a viable option. The authors use a grounded theory
approach to investigate this important issue. Based on in-depth
interviews with 40 supplier managers and executives in multiple
industries, the authors identify: (a) types of out-ofcontract
alternatives for resolving breaches, (b) factors that lead to use of
enforcement options outside the terms specified in the contract, (c)
contextual influences, and (d) individual and firm-level consequences of
outside-ofcontract enforcement.</p>

<p>Initiating value co-creation: Dealing with non-receptive customers</p>
<p>deal with co-creation reluctance. co-creation to improve the offering.</p>
<p>Scholarly emphasis on the significance of integrating customer and
supplier work processes to co-create customer value is increasingly
important. While suppliers and customers working closely is imperative
for the success of the value co-creation (VCC) process, customers’
reluctance at times to allow suppliers into their environments has not
been fully explored. The present study is an expansive qualitative
inquiry consisting of 114 in-depth interviews across 57
business-to-business evaluations that aims to understand both the
nuanced nature of customer non-receptivity to specific VCC initiatives
and those strategies suppliers may adopt to successfully manage it.
Findings elicit three potential kinds of customer non-receptivity:
apathy, ambivalence, and annoyance. Furthermore, conclusions propose six
strategies suppliers may use to manage customer non-receptivity:
intrinsic initiative, inspiration and implementation, complexity
absorption, value alignment, credibility building, and objective
centrality.</p>

<p>Salesperson Solution Involvement and Sales Performance: The Contingent
Role of Supplier Firm and Customer–Supplier Relationship
Characteristics</p>
<p>salespeople invovled in the solution (not solution selling)’s impaact on
the long term performance</p>
<p>Salespeople play a crucial role in their firms’ efforts to provide
customer solutions. However, little research has examined how
salesperson involvement in customer solutions can be conceptualized,
whether it pays off, and what boundary conditions might heighten its
performance effects. This study addresses these gaps and offers a
conceptualization of salesperson solution involvement by focusing on the
set of salesperson-related activities that enact the four relational
processes inherent in customer solutions. The authors collect a unique
data set that includes a wide range of firms, industries, and countries,
as well as the perspectives of both salespeople and customers, across
five studies. Results validate the stability of the conceptualization
across contexts. They also reveal that salesperson solution involvement
is systematically related to increases in both subjective and objective,
time-lagged measures of sales performance. Finally, results show that
the performance effects of salesperson solution involvement are
amplified under higher levels of firm’s product portfolio scope, sales
unit cross-functional cooperation, and customer–supplier relationship
tie strength. Surprisingly, customer adaptiveness is not found to
moderate the performance effects of salesperson solution involvement.</p>

<p>In business-to-government and business-to-business transactions,
suppliers often have limited access to buyers during the buying process.
The authors term these buyers “barricaded buyers.” Despite the
prevalence of barricaded buyers in practice, research has remained
largely silent on the topic. Therefore, the authors combine insights
from eight organizational purchasing case studies and individual
interviews with signaling theory to advance a conceptual framework that
highlights ways a supplier can increase its competitiveness (and,
correspondingly, its selection likelihood) when selling to barricaded
buyers. The framework reflects three distinct ways in which signaling
occurs or influences the barricaded buying process: the seller signals
to buyers (e.g., through novel solutions, explicit responding), the
seller signals to competing sellers (e.g., through peacocking), and the
buyer signals to sellers whose meaning is jammed (e.g., through
supplier-specific capabilities and language). The framework invokes
barricade restrictiveness as an important contingency variable that
lends nuance to when the signaling activities are most likely to affect
suppliers’ competitiveness.</p>
